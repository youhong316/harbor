### 1. Notary
The notary feature allows publishers to sign their images offline and to push the signed content to a notary server. This ensures the authenticity of images.

### 2. Vulnerability Scanning
The capability to scan images for vulnerability.

### 3. Image replication enhancement 
To provide more sophisticated rule for image replication. 
- Image filtering by tags
- Replication can be scheduled at a certain time using a rule like: one time only, daily, weekly, etc.
- Image deletion can have the option not to be replicated to a remote instance.
- Global replication rule: Instead of setting the rule of individual project, system admin can set a global rule for all projects.
- Project admin can set replication policy of the project.

### 4. Authentication (OAuth2) 
In addition to LDAP/AD and local users, OAuth 2.0 can be used to authenticate a user.

### 5. High Availability 
Support multi-node deployment of Harbor for high availability, scalability and load-balancing purposes.

### 6. Statistics and description for repositories
User can add a description to a repository. The access count of a repo can be aggregated and displayed.

### 7. Migration tool to move from an existing registry to Harbor 
A tool to migrate images from a vanilla registry server to Harbor, without the need to export/import a large amount of data.
